* Changes in v1.1.1

  - Clean up the output from DisPass when prompting, trim whitespace
    from the front and end of the prompt.

  - Don't have the filter try and kill the bufer, the sentinel should
    handle this.

  - Don't call ~dispass-add-label~ in ~dispass-cerate~, let DisPass
    handle this.

  - Fix a bug that would cause a new window to be created each time
    the dispass.el completion was built.

* Changes in v1.1

  - Use ~dispass-label~ to get a list of labels the user has maed, use
    this for ~dispass-list-labels~ and adding completion options for
    ~dispass~.

* Changes in v1

  - Add the ~dispass-list-labels~ command, which shows a list of all
    the labels in ~dispass-file~.  Some management of labels is
    possible in this list, namely adding and deleting labels.

  - ~dispass-create~ automatically adds "created" labels to
    ~dispass-file~.

  - Store a default length in ~dispass-default-length~.  When no length
    is given or found in the labels file, this length will be passed
    on to DisPass.

  - Fix the regular expression used in ~dispass-process-filter-for~ to
    support DisPass v0.1a8.

* Changes in v0.1a7.3

  - Add the possibility to cut passwords short by using a numeric
    prefix argument.

  - Add the ~dispass-executable~ option, which holds the location of the
    DisPass executable script.  It can be changed through the Emacs
    customization interface.

  - Add a customization group named ~dispass~, it is found under the
    ~External~ group.

* Changes in v0.1a7.2

  - Kill the buffer when we're winished with it.
